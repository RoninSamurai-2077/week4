9) Declare a variable named var1
//10) Assign a string data type value to var1
//11) Write the value of var1 to the console
//12) Write a blank line to the console. (I showed one way to do this in class, there are some others feel free to use those instead if you'd like, practice your google-fu)
//13) Define and assign a variable named var2, the value should be of the number type
//14) Evaluate var1 + var2 and write the result to the console (You can store the result in a variable and write it to the console, or pass the expression into a method that will remain un-named)
//15) Could you guess the result? Write your guess in an inline comment next to where you're writing it to the console
//16) Add in a multi line comment and write some of the types we covered in class today on individual lines
//17) Write the type of the var1 variable to the console
//18) Can you guess the result? Write your guess in an inline comment next to where you're writing to the console.
//19) Declare a variable named var3 and assign it the string value text
//20) Write the value of var3 to the console
//20) Reassign var3 to a boolean value
//21) Write the value of var3 to the console
//22) Reassign var1 to the number 5
//23) Reassign var2 to the string 5
//24) In any order or in however many lines you'd like, parse var2 from a string to a number and add it to var1, write your result to the console.
